# Art-Verse

_by Katia Liashevska_

## Description of the project

Art-Verse is the second project I created during my 2023 Ironhack bootcamp in full-stack web development. I was inspired by [Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/), an amazing plaform used by everybody working in the art field on a daily basis. This is a very simplified version that I created from scratch in 6 days.
The app allows you to view a catalogue of 100 modern art masterpieces from the collection of one of the world's major art museums, [The Art Institute of Chicago](https://www.artic.edu/), and add as many of them as you would like to your favourites list that you can access on a dedicated page. It's a way to create your own digital art collection based on an incredible selection of top-tier artworks.

## Tech stack

This app was made using ReactJS.
It is integrated with a [public external API](https://api.artic.edu/docs/) kindly provided by The Art Institute of Chicago as well as a mock backend that I made to be able to perform Create, Read & Delete operations.

## Features

-   Scroll through all the artworks on the home page and see their title, author and date on a simple hover
-   Check the details and the large format image of each artwork in a dedicated modal by clicking on it
-   Add artworks to your favourites and remove them if you change your mind
-   The favourites page features your selection organised in a list
